# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System (Java OOP)
A simple, Java-based movie ticket booking system was developed as part of an academic project at NMIMS University. The application allows users to browse movies, select seats, apply basic promotions, and simulate payments, all through clean Object-Oriented Programming.

# 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open in any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans)
3. Run the Main class to begin booking

# 🧩 Overview & Features
This project is a Java-based movie ticket booking system built entirely using core Object-Oriented Programming principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. The system is fully hardcoded with no external dependencies or database, making it lightweight and easy to run.
- Key functionalities include:
1. 🎞️ Viewing available movies and screens
2. 🪑 Seat selection across VIP, Regular, and Economy types
3. 🔐 Basic customer login with email format validation
4. 💳 Simulated payment via Credit Card or PayPal
5. 🎟️ Early bird discount logic through a promotion interface
6. 💰 Ticket cost calculation with real-time pricing and offers
Designed with simplicity, clarity, and extensibility in mind, this project serves as a learning-focused implementation of Java OOP concepts in a real-world context.
